# E-Whale - User Frontend

Welcome to E-Whale, an innovative solution for managing and picking up electronic waste. This repository contains the client-side (frontend) of the E-Whale application that interacts with users.

## About The Project

E-Whale is a web platform designed to make the process of recycling electronic waste (e-waste) easier for the community. Inspired by whales, which are often threatened by waste, E-Whale aims to reduce the negative impact of electronic waste on the environment.

This application allows users to select the type of e-waste to be picked up, schedule a pickup time, and track the order status in real-time.

### Key Features

* **User Authentication:** Registration, login, OTP verification, and password recovery system.
* **E-Waste Catalog:** Users can browse various types of electronic waste available for pickup.
* **Cart System:** Add or adjust the quantity of waste for pickup.
* **Pickup Scheduling:** Users can select their preferred date and time for pickup.
* **Order Tracking:** Monitor the status of the pickup in real-time, from waiting to completion.
* **Profile Management:** Users can manage their personal data, address, and change their password.
* **Informative Pages:** An "About Us" page that introduces the team behind the E-Whale project.
